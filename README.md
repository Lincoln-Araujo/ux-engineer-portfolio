## This repository includes  

- ðŸ’» **Demo projects** â€“ code samples built with modern frameworks (React, Next.js, Tailwind).  
- ðŸ“‘ **Case notes** â€“ short write-ups describing real-world projects I contributed to (e.g., AgÃªncia Gov, Canal Gov), including the challenges, solutions, and results.
