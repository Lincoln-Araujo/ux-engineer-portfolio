## 💡 Note on My Design Process  

Since I often act as both the **designer and developer** on projects, my Figma files are usually more **practical and layout-focused** rather than fully fleshed-out design systems.  
I prioritize turning concepts into working code quickly, ensuring **accessibility and performance**, while still keeping designs consistent and user-friendly.
