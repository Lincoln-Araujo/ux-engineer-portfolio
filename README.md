## This repository includes  

- ðŸ’» **Demo projects** â€“ code samples built with modern frameworks (React, Next.js, Tailwind).  
- ðŸ“‘ **Case notes** â€“ short write-ups describing real-world projects I contributed to (e.g., AgÃªncia Gov, RÃ¡dio Gov), including the challenges, solutions, and results.
  > Below are a few selected case notes highlighting real-world projects and a personal demo aligned with modern stacks.
- ðŸŽ¨ **UX design work** â€“ prototypes and wireframes created in Figma.

## Case Notes  

### 1. AgÃªncia Gov Redesign 

**Tech stack:** Plone CMS, React, Custom Frontend  

**Context:** AgÃªncia Gov is the official federal government news portal in Brazil, reaching citizens across the country with daily updates.  

**Challenge:** The old platform was difficult to navigate, lacked mobile responsiveness, and didnâ€™t fully comply with accessibility standards.  

**My contribution:** Collaborated with designers, editors, and stakeholders to implement a full redesign. Built responsive layouts, applied WCAG accessibility guidelines, and developed reusable components to standardize the front-end.  

**Impact / Results:** The new platform reached **42M+ views in its first year**, offering faster access to government news and significantly improving usability for millions of citizens.

### 2. RÃ¡dio Gov Launch  

**Tech stack:** Plone CMS, Custom Frontend, REST API integration  

**Context:** RÃ¡dio Gov was created as a new digital platform for distributing government audio content to citizens, with a focus on accessibility and regional/national reach.  

**Challenge:** The project required a modern, user-friendly platform that could handle continuous audio distribution, integrate with existing radio systems, and deliver content across devices.  

**My contribution:** Implemented the front-end structure with Plone CMS, ensuring responsive layouts and accessible navigation. Collaborated with designers and backend developers to integrate audio streaming via REST APIs and optimize performance.  

**Impact / Results:** RÃ¡dio Gov successfully launched in 2024, expanding EBCâ€™s reach in audio distribution. The platform had measurable impact on both regional and national radio stations, making government audio content more accessible to diverse audiences.

### 3. Next.js + Tailwind Demo  

**Tech stack:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  

**Context:** A personal demo project created to practice and showcase modern front-end development aligned with Baymardâ€™s stack.  

**Challenge:** Demonstrate the ability to structure a small web application using Next.js and Tailwind, focusing on component reusability, accessibility, and responsive design.  

**My contribution:** Designed and implemented a simple landing page with reusable components (header, card grid, responsive navigation). Applied accessibility best practices (semantic HTML, ARIA attributes) and ensured mobile-first responsiveness.  

**Impact / Results:** The project demonstrates proficiency in Next.js and Tailwind CSS, showing my ability to quickly adapt to modern frameworks and build clean, maintainable UI code.
